# AlternativeDotNetWebFrameworksSample

Messing around with some different ways to implement web APIs in .NET, besides the usual MVC.

Included at the moment:

- Using C#
    - MVC
    - Route to code (using endpoints directly)
    - FeatherHttp (also using route to code)
    - Carter
- Using F#
    - Giraffe
    - Suave

Important note: this was the first time I touched F#, so I'm pretty sure I've messed up somewhere ðŸ™‚
